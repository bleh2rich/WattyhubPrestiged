- Loadstring
```
 loadstring(game:HttpGet(('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bleh2rich/WattyhubPrestiged/main/WattyhubPrestiged.lua'),true))()
```

Notes: When teleporting if the teleport doesnt go through due to there being no seat and your inputs start being delayed just pull out your punch tool and punch once itll fix the delay rather than waiting 10-20 seconds

WattyhubPrestiged is the continued version of Wattyhub for the few GRG exploiters left I will be adding onto this as I feel alongside saying what will be added next

Soon to be added will be listed below
```
- Ability for any role to enter council voting


- Auto escape prison


- A tab dedicated to every singular tool buy (that will function only if that tool is bought)


- Possibly something to show what in the town has been bought like a sidebar GUI that will show whether or not something in the town is bought or not


- An updated ESP library due to the old one being used not being the best but still functioning


- A Autobuy food when your hunger gets low to make sure you dont starve even if you're paying attention


- A bypassed working noclip


- Auto leader stats which you will type the wage and tax rate and food price you want when you're leader or if you're already leader it'll change the stats for you automatically instead of you taking ages to change them


- Automated infinite leader which will automate the infinite leader glitch for you though this might or might not be possible
```

- A tab that will contain the 3rd feature and also allow you to buy every buyable thing on the map making it much easier to get around and buy whatever is needed


- A panic button in the player tab which will be bindable if I can get it bindable to where whenever you click the binded key near death itll take you somewhere private instantly hopefully saving you from near death
